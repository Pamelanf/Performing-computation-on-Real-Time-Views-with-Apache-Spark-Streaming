# Performing-computation-on-Real-Time-Views-with-Apache-Spark-Streaming
In this project, we are going to work with the concept of Lambda Architecture to manage and analyse Big Data, so first we are going to set up our system to work with Apache Spark and Apache Cassandra, then we are going to perform some live streaming computations and it will be stored the results in Apache Cassandra.
